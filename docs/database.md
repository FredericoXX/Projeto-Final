# Database Notes

## Migration history

| Order | Revision | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `db13417f9dc4` | Enable the `pgvector` extension |
| 2 | `de4e133df3c9` | Create the `institutions` table |
| 3 | `9cf6ff5ac49c` | Create the `users` table with `institution_id` and the required multi-institution fields |

Since the project is still in local-only development with no shared
environments, no production data, and disposable databases, the `users`
migration was rewritten in place to create the table already correctly
shaped for the multi-institution model, instead of adding a fourth
migration to alter it later. There is no separate "complete `users`"
migration — the historical migration itself is now correct.

The `users` table (as created by `9cf6ff5ac49c`) has:

- `id` — UUID, primary key, application-generated via the ORM default
- `institution_id` — UUID, `NOT NULL`, foreign key to `institutions.id`, indexed
- `full_name` — `String(255)`, `NOT NULL`
- `email` — `String(255)`, `NOT NULL`, globally unique
- `password_hash` — `String(255)`, `NOT NULL`
- `role` — `String(50)`, `NOT NULL`, server default `"user"`
- `is_active` — `Boolean`, `NOT NULL`, server default `true`
- `created_at` — timezone-aware timestamp, `NOT NULL`, server default `now()`
- `updated_at` — timezone-aware timestamp, `NOT NULL`, server default `now()`

`email` uniqueness remains global (not scoped per institution) — that is
unchanged from the original design and was not revisited in this pass.

The `institutions` and `users` tables already have a full API on top of
them: institution management endpoints, a user management API scoped to
the authenticated admin's institution, and JWT + Argon2 based
authentication (login and initial-admin registration). See
[`app/api/routes/institutions.py`](../backend/app/api/routes/institutions.py),
[`app/api/routes/users.py`](../backend/app/api/routes/users.py) and
[`app/api/routes/auth.py`](../backend/app/api/routes/auth.py).

## Current status

The next block built on top of this schema is `conversations` and
`messages`: a conversation belongs to one institution and one user, and
groups the messages exchanged in an assistant session. This phase only
covers persistence and CRUD-style endpoints — no RAG, embeddings,
retrieval or LLM generation is implemented yet.
